Hi, I have completed all the requirements for this project.

All the backend code is written laravel
 All the frontend code is written in vue js which calls the api's sending token to get data and show data to user and user can manipulate that data

2 classes for test cases , 1 for web and other for Api's(all the routes have test cases)

Here is the video of complete working functionality using Vue js
