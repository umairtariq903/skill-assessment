Hi, I have completed all the requirements for this project.

2 web pages which are password secured and back and forth navigation

3 Api's which are token secured and Laravel Auth is used for the authentication of API's

2 classes for test cases , 1 for web and other for Api's(all the routes have test cases)

Here is the video of complete working functionality

Technical Details:

I have added comments on my controller methods and explained the purpose of each method
I have used 'dummy' as password in the seed class that i made to seed database.
I have used this api key in my test cases
